			The following are the required and optional fields for a post request to this url. Puzzles will be solved with a <mark>Breadth-first approach</mark>. 
			<br>
			<h3>
				Required:
			</h3>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<code>graph</code>
				<ul>
					Type: String 
					<br>
					Info: This is a representation of the graph that will be solved by the API. A sample for the required input can be seen below.
					<br>
					Sample: <code>|||||,|000|,|**0$,|||||</code>
					<br>
					<br>
					The sample above can be visualized as:
					<ul>
						<p class="text-info">
							<font face="Courier">
								||||| <br>
								|000| <br>
								|**0$ <br>
								|||||
							</font>
						</p>
					</ul>
					For this sample you can see that the <mark>player</mark> is represented by the <code>**</code> in the map. The goal for the player is represented by the <code>$</code>. Walls are represented by <code>|</code> and they must surround the map else the given map will be declared invalid. Lastly, any non-player piece can be represented by any character. So looking at a more complex example:
					<ul>
						<p class="text-info">
							<font face="Courier">
								|||||||| <br>
								|102333| <br>
								|102455| <br>
								|1**467$ <br>
								|080067| <br>
								|08aa6b| <br>
								|99000b| <br>
								||||||||
							</font>
						</p>
					</ul>
					It can be seen that one pice is represented by three ones vertically. These three are treated as one big piece and will only be able to move vertically. Similarly, the two horizontal nines are treated as one big piece and can only move horizontally. 
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<h3>
				Optional:
			</h3>
			<div>
				<ul>
					<code>delimeter</code>
					<ul>
						Type: string
						<br>
						Info: This is how the map is broken up by rows. For the sample above, the delimeter would be <code>","</code>. The default <code>delimeter</code> is <code>"\n"</code>.
					</ul>
					<br>
					<code>graphOutput</code>
					<ul>
						Type: boolean
						<br>
						Info: This decides the kind of output that will be provided to the caller. If this is not provied a list of moves will be given to the user which is where the default for <code>graphOutput</code> is <code>False</code>. 
						<br>
						<br>
						<code>False</code>: A list of moves will be provided in the format of <mark>piece, right, up</mark> where the piece is the piece to be moved, right is how far right the piece should move, and up is how far up the piece should be moved. 
						<br>
						<code>True</code>: A list of graphs will be provided, separated by new lines <code>"\n"</code>, that show how the puzzle can be solved optimally. 
					</ul>
				</ul>
