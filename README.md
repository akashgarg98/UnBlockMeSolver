# Unblock Me Solver

This repository aims to create a solver for puzzles found in applications like ```Unblock Me```. To do so it implements several solving methods including A\*, breadth first search, and depth first search. In addition a server will be implemented and hosted on heroku to provide a web service that users can call to solve their puzzles.
