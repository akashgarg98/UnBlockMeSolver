# Generating Puzzles

This will, potentially, feature multiple ways of generating boards. What follows will be a list and the corresponding folder in which the generation method is implemented. 

	1. [MarkovChainGeneration](MarkovChainGeneration) aims to generate maps with markov chains
	2. [LongestPath](LongestPath) aims to generate maps by randomly placing pieces on the board and then find a unique position on the board with most amount of moves to solve.
